# Data Visualization With Power BI
Slides, Power BI Desktop files and helpers used in netcoreconf.

We live in the era of data. We are surrounded by data. There are tons of tools, methodologies, software, processes, etc. to extract, transform and load from just a couple or records to even tens of millions of records.
But what about after all that? How can we make so much data usable? The key is to extract the inner insights existing on data, and the best way to detect, identify and transmit insights is visualization.
We will learn how to uncover the underlying truth of our datasets creating simple but effective visualizations with Power BI, what are the most common mistakes and how to avoid them, and finally how to build a story to deliver the intrinsic message that lies beneath our data to our audience.
